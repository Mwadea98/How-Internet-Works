        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Today, cybercrime has a huge problem for society, personally, financially and in even in matters of national security. In the last few years, hundreds of, millions of credit cards have been stolen. Even nuclear centrifuge has been hacked etc. This is all done by exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware and software or by making unintentional decisions made by people using software i.e. YOU.</p>
        <h1>Who are these people</h1>
        <p>People committing cybercrimes don't fit a single profile. It can be anybody either an international terrorist or a teenager. Today, larger counter doesn’t only have a regular army but also a well-armed cyber army. The next world war may not be fought with traditional weapons but with computer by shutting down the national water power supply, energy girds and transportation systems</p>
        <h1>Ways of committing cybercrime:</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Viruses</li>
          <li>Ddos</li>
          <li>Phishing</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Virus:</h1>
        <p>
          An organism that spread through air bone or physical spread.
          How does virus infect
          1. Fake Installation
          2. Security Backdoor
          Once a virus is on your computer, it can steal of delete your files, control programs or even perform remote operations
          Using computer viruses, hackers can take over millions of computers worldwide.
        </p>
        <h1>DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service):</h1>
        <p>Hackers overwhelm a website with too many requests and we call it distributed denial when attacks come from many computers all at once
          Most Websites can handle millions of request but when you hit them with billions or trillions of request, they are overloaded.
        </p>
        <h1>PHISING</h1>
        <p>
          Trick people into sharing sensitive personal information. Its look like a trust worthy page or email and ask you’re to login or share your personal passwords. That is a fake page and hackers steals your information.
          Fortunately, there are many companies, laws and government working to make internet safer.
          90% of the time when a system gets hacked is not because of a security bug but because a simple mistake made by human.
          Steps we all must take to avoid getting hacked
          1.Use strong passwords
          2.Check for authentic web addresses
          3.Install system security updates often
          4.Don't install software you don't trust
